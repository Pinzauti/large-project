\chapter{Abstract}
The aim of this work is to attempt a competition by IBM on an open problem related to quantum simulation.
This writeup is divided in three chapters. In the first chapter we give a brief and quick overview at the field of quantum computation. This it is not meant to be by any means complete, and we remind to \cite{NielsenChuang} for further deepening. However this first chapter should give to the reader all the tools in order to be able to read this work.

In the second chapter we take a look at quantum simulation, what it is, how it is done, and how it is done in practice. Again, this is not mean to be complete at all, as we describe the only techniques that will be used in the challenge.

We finish with the third chapter, where we introduce the actual competition and the strategy we have adopted to solve it.

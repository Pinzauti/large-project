\chapter{Quantum Simulation}\label{chap:2}
\epigraph{Can physics be simulated by a universal computer? [...] the physical world is quantum mechanical, and therefore the proper problem is the simulation of quantum physics [...] the full description of quantum mechanics for a large system with $R$ particles [...] has too many variables, it cannot be simulated with a normal computer with a number of elements proportional to $R \quad[\ldots$ but it can be simulated with] quantum computer elements. [...] Can a quantum system be probabilistically simulated by a classical (probabilistic, I'd assume) universal computer? [...] If you take the computer to be the classical kind I've described so far [..] the answer is certainly, No!}{Richard P. Feynman (1982)}
Quantum simulation is the area of quantum computation which seems, at the time of writing, to provide the most useful and efficient applications. In this chapter we are going to present the main and most basic tools of quantum simulation, focusing on a specific techniques: trotterization.
